# This is my solution to challenge by FrontendMentor: Expenses Chart Component

As per assignment, :hover shall have been used to display the info for the day. :hover doesn't work the way I like on mobile screen, making it practically impossible to check out the amount of $ for any given day on the phone. Therefore, I used hover for screens above 531px, and "click" event listener on all the screens below 530px.
